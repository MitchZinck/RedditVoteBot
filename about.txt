Hello,
You will be installing a script that runs every 10 minutes (if you are browsing) and checks if there is a post I want upvoted. If so a new tab will be opened and you will have to upvote the post manually. Upvote tracking will be done to make sure your account is upvoting properly.
 
You must install Greasemonkey/TamperMonkey(Firefox/Chrome) and then copy and install your respective script (Chrome/Firefox):
Chrome--> http://whatyearis.it/karmabot/gm_chrome.js
Firefox--> http://whatyearis.it/karmabot/gm_firefox.js
 
After that you will be voting occasionally for $5 a week. If I make more business than usual it will be $10 a week.
Payment will be BTC or Paypal every Friday.
 
If there are any problems or the script bugs out PM me and disable the script.
Cheers!
